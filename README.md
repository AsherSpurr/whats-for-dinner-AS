# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. You will be building an app that helps users choose a recipe and put together meals. 

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/dinner.html).

# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> Created basic webpage from style sheet. Added functionality to radio buttons and let's cook button which shows a title of meals to make.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> open index.html from the repo.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> Unsure how to do this at the moment.

### Context:
[//]: <> This took me around 20-25 hours to make. I am only a few weeks into Mod 1. Most time was spent custom creating circles in CSS before learning o radio styles.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> Only I was working on this project. https://github.com/AsherSpurr

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> The learning goals of this project from my understanding was to understand and implament HTML, CSS, and JS all together.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> Some wins from this project was before making the radio inputs I custom made outer and inner circles to act as buttons, where in a function I changed the coloring so it would appear like a highlighted radio button. I also linked the background image successfully. There were a lot of challenges to overcome. Mainly was my basic understanding of how these 3 interfaces interacted. Along with creating more complex functions and understanding the order or operations and combining different functions with each other. CSS styling continues to baffle me as well. I got over most of these with the dev tools or by asking chat GPT "I am trying to do XYZ, here is my code, i'm getting this error, could you explain why?"
